
To create a module for VNPayment in Laravel, similar to the Stripe example you provided, we need to follow a similar approach but customize it for VNPayment. VNPayment is a popular payment gateway in Vietnam, so this module will specifically cater to integrating VNPayment into a Laravel application.

I'll outline the steps and provide examples for creating a VNPayment module. The process involves creating the necessary classes, models, and configurations specific to VNPayment.

Step 1: Create a Laravel Module for VNPayment

bash
Copy code
php artisan module:make VNPayment
Step 2: Add “gateway:true” to module.json for VNPayment

json
Copy code
{
    "name": "VNPayment",
    "gateway": true,
    // ... other module settings
}
Step 3: Create a Scope Class for VNPayment
Create VNPaymentScope inside the Scope directory of your VNPayment module.

php
Copy code
namespace Modules\VNPayment\Scope;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\{Builder, Model, Scope};

class VNPaymentScope implements Scope
{
    public function apply(Builder $builder, Model $model)
    {
        $builder->where('gateway', 'vnpayment');
    }
}
Step 4: Creating a Custom Gateway Model for VNPayment

php
Copy code
namespace Modules\VNPayment\Entities;

use Modules\VNPayment\Scope\VNPaymentScope;
use Modules\Gateway\Entities\Gateway;

class VNPayment extends Gateway
{
    protected $table = 'gateways';
    protected $appends = ['image_url'];

    protected static function booted()
    {
        static::addGlobalScope(new VNPaymentScope());
    }
}
Step 5: Create the Custom Gateway "VNPaymentBody" Model

php
Copy code
namespace Modules\VNPayment\Entities;

use Modules\Gateway\Entities\GatewayBody;

class VNPaymentBody extends GatewayBody
{
    public $vnp_TmnCode;
    public $vnp_HashSecret;
    public $instruction;
    public $status;
    public $sandbox;

    public function __construct($request)
    {
        $this->vnp_TmnCode = $request->vnp_TmnCode;
        $this->vnp_HashSecret = $request->vnp_HashSecret;
        $this->instruction = $request->instruction;
        $this->status = $request->status;
        $this->sandbox = $request->sandbox;
    }
}
Step 6: Configure the VNPayment Module

php
Copy code
return [
    'name' => 'VNPayment',
    'alias' => 'vnpayment',
    'logo' => 'Modules/VNPayment/Resources/assets/vnpayment.png',
    // VNPayment settings
    'options' => [
        // ... options and settings
    ],
    'validation' => [
        'rules' => [
            'vnp_TmnCode' => 'required',
            'vnp_HashSecret' => 'required',
            'sandbox' => 'required',
        ],
        'attributes' => [
            'vnp_TmnCode' => __('TmnCode'),
            'vnp_HashSecret' => __('HashSecret'),
            'sandbox' => __('Sandbox mode')
        ]
    ],
    'fields' => [
        // ... fields and settings
    ],
    'store_route' => 'vnpayment.store',
];
Step 7: Create a Request File for VNPayment Credentials

php
Copy code
namespace Modules\VNPayment\Http\Requests;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\FormRequest;

class VNPaymentRequest extends FormRequest
{
    public function rules()
    {
        return moduleConfig('vnpayment.validation')['rules'];
    }

    public function authorize()
    {
        return true;
    }

    public function attributes()
    {
        return moduleConfig('vnpayment.validation')['attributes'];
    }
}
Step 8: Add Routes for VNPayment

php
Copy code
Route::group(['prefix' => 'gateway/vnpayment', 'as' => 'vnpayment.', 'namespace' => 'Modules\VNPayment\Http\Controllers', 'middleware' => ['auth', 'permission', 'locale']], function () {
    Route::post('/store', 'VNPaymentController@store')->name('store');
    Route::get('/edit', 'VNPaymentController@edit')->name('edit');
});
Step 9: Add Methods to the VNPayment Controller
Implement store and edit methods in VNPaymentController.

Step 10: Create a Payment View Class for VNPayment
Create VNPaymentView in the Views directory of the VNPayment module.

Step 11: Create a Payment Blade View File
Create pay.blade.php for VNPayment with the necessary HTML and form elements.

Step 12: Create a Response Class for VNPayment Payments
Implement VNPaymentResponse extending a base response class and handling VNPayment responses.

Step 13: Create a Payment Processor Class for VNPayment
Implement VNPaymentProcessor handling payment transactions.

Since you've uploaded two PHP files (vnpay_pay.php and config.php), I will review them to see how they can be integrated into these steps or adjusted for the VNPayment module. Let's start with vnpay_pay.php.

The vnpay_pay.php file appears to be a HTML template, likely used for the payment process with VNPayment. The first few lines indicate standard HTML structure with meta tags and a title of "Tạo mới đơn hàng" (translated as "Create a new order"). This file is probably used for displaying the payment interface to the user.

Given its HTML structure, this file is likely meant to be integrated into the Laravel application as a view. It could be used in the payment process step, specifically in the payment view class (VNPaymentView) or the Blade view file (pay.blade.php) I mentioned in Step 11 of the module creation process.

Now, let's take a look at the config.php file to understand its contents and see how it can be integrated into the VNPayment module configuration. ​​

The config.php file seems to be a configuration file for the VNPayment integration. It includes settings such as vnp_TmnCode (merchant identifier), vnp_HashSecret (secret key), vnp_Url (VNPayment API URL), and vnp_Returnurl (return URL after payment). These settings are essential for the VNPayment gateway integration.

This file should be integrated into the Laravel module as part of the configuration settings. The parameters defined in config.php can be used in the VNPayment module's configuration file (as outlined in Step 6). They are crucial for setting up the VNPayment gateway and ensuring that it communicates correctly with the VNPayment API.

Here's how you can integrate these settings into the Laravel module:

Config Integration: The contents of config.php should be included in the VNPayment module's config.php file. This will centralize all the configuration settings required for the VNPayment gateway.

Usage in Classes: The configuration settings (like vnp_TmnCode, vnp_HashSecret, etc.) should be accessed in the relevant classes, such as VNPaymentBody, VNPaymentProcessor, and VNPaymentResponse. These settings will be used for initiating transactions, validating responses, and processing payments.

Environment Variables: For security and flexibility, consider storing sensitive information like vnp_TmnCode and vnp_HashSecret in environment variables (.env file) instead of directly in the configuration file. Laravel's configuration system can then access these variables.

Adjusting the Payment View: The HTML content in vnpay_pay.php should be adapted to fit into the Laravel Blade template system. You can use this HTML structure in the pay.blade.php file to ensure a consistent user interface for the payment process.

Return URL Handling: The vnp_Returnurl setting should be configured to point to a route in your Laravel application that handles the payment response from VNPayment.

By integrating these components into your Laravel module, you can effectively set up a VNPayment gateway that handles transactions, processes payments, and manages the payment flow within your Laravel application. ​​

This model will represent the VNPayment gateway in the database.

php
Copy code
<?php

namespace Modules\VNPayment\Entities;

use Modules\VNPayment\Scope\VNPaymentScope;
use Modules\Gateway\Entities\Gateway;

class VNPayment extends Gateway
{
    protected $table = 'gateways';
    protected $appends = ['image_url'];

    protected static function booted()
    {
        static::addGlobalScope(new VNPaymentScope());
    }
}

    public function __construct($request)
    {
        $this->vnp_TmnCode = $request->vnp_TmnCode;
        $this->vnp_HashSecret = $request->vnp_HashSecret;
        $this->instruction = $request->instruction;
        $this->status = $request->status;
        $this->sandbox = $request->sandbox;
    }
}
5. VNPayment Payment View (VNPaymentView.php)
This class will render the payment view for VNPayment.

php
Copy code
<?php

namespace Modules\VNPayment\Views;

use Modules\Gateway\Contracts\PaymentViewInterface;

class VNPaymentView implements PaymentViewInterface
{
    public static function paymentView($key)
    {
        // Logic to render the VNPayment payment view
        return view('vnpayment::pay', [
            // Pass necessary data to the view
        ]);
    }
}
6. VNPayment Blade View File (pay.blade.php)
This Blade file will be the template for the payment page.

blade
Copy code
@extends('gateway::layouts.payment')

@section('logo', asset(moduleConfig('vnpayment.logo')))

@section('gateway', moduleConfig('vnpayment.name'))

@section('content')
    <!-- Payment form and other content goes here -->
@endsection
7. VNPayment Processor Class (VNPaymentProcessor.php)
This class will handle payment processing for VNPayment.

php
Copy code
<?php

namespace Modules\VNPayment\Processor;

use Modules\Gateway\Contracts\PaymentProcessorInterface;

class VNPaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessorInterface
{
    public function pay($request)
    {
        // Implement payment logic
    }

    // Additional methods as required
}
These files and code snippets form the backbone of the VNPayment module in a Laravel application. You'll need to adapt and expand upon these examples based on the specific requirements of your application and the VNPayment API. Also, remember to include proper error handling, validation, and security practices in your implementation.

Sure, let's continue with the implementation of the VNPaymentProcessor.php and outline the additional steps necessary to complete the VNPayment module.

VNPayment Processor Class (Processors/VNPaymentProcessor.php)
This class is responsible for handling the payment processing logic for VNPayment.

php
Copy code
<?php

namespace Modules\VNPayment\Processors;

use Modules\Gateway\Contracts\PaymentProcessorInterface;
use Modules\VNPayment\Entities\VNPaymentBody;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class VNPaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessorInterface
{
    public function pay(Request $request)
    {
        // Create VNPaymentBody instance from the request
        $vnpaymentBody = new VNPaymentBody($request);

        // Here, you can add the logic to create the payment transaction with VNPayment
        // For instance, creating a payment URL with VNPayment parameters

        $vnp_Url = config('vnpayment.vnp_Url');
        $vnp_Returnurl = config('vnpayment.vnp_Returnurl');
        $vnp_TmnCode = $vnpaymentBody->vnp_TmnCode;
        $vnp_HashSecret = $vnpaymentBody->vnp_HashSecret;

        $vnp_OrderInfo = "Payment description"; // You can dynamically set this
        $vnp_Amount = $request->amount * 100; // Example amount, should be dynamic
        $vnp_BankCode = $request->bankCode; // Example bank code, should be dynamic
        $vnp_TxnRef = date('YmdHis'); // Unique transaction reference

        $vnpayData = [
            'vnp_Version' => '2.0.0',
            'vnp_TmnCode' => $vnp_TmnCode,
            'vnp_Amount' => $vnp_Amount,
            'vnp_Command' => 'pay',
            'vnp_CreateDate' => date('YmdHis'),
            'vnp_CurrCode' => 'VND',
            'vnp_IpAddr' => request()->ip(),
            'vnp_Locale' => 'vn',
            'vnp_OrderInfo' => $vnp_OrderInfo,
            'vnp_ReturnUrl' => $vnp_Returnurl,
            'vnp_TxnRef' => $vnp_TxnRef,
            // ... other VNPayment parameters
        ];

        // Generate the secure hash
        ksort($vnpayData);
        $query = '';
        foreach ($vnpayData as $key => $value) {
            $query .= $key . "=" . $value . "&";
        }

        $vnp_SecureHash = hash('sha256', $vnp_HashSecret . $query);
        $vnpayData['vnp_SecureHashType'] = 'SHA256';
        $vnpayData['vnp_SecureHash'] = $vnp_SecureHash;

        $paymentUrl = $vnp_Url . "?" . http_build_query($vnpayData);

        // Redirect to the VNPayment page
        return redirect()->to($paymentUrl);
    }

    // Implement other methods as required
}
Additional Steps to Complete VNPayment Module:
8. Handle Payment Responses
Create a controller method to handle the response from VNPayment. This should match the vnp_Returnurl defined in your configuration.

php
Copy code
// In your VNPaymentController

public function handlePaymentResponse(Request $request)
{
    // Validate the response using vnp_SecureHash
    // You can use similar logic as in VNPaymentProcessor to generate and compare the hash

    // Check the payment result and update your application's payment status accordingly

    // Redirect or inform the user about the payment status
}
9. Update Route Definitions
Define routes in routes/web.php for handling VNPayment payment initiation and response.

php
Copy code
Route::post('/vnpayment/pay', 'VNPaymentController@pay')->name('vnpayment.pay');
Route::get('/vnpayment/response', 'VNPaymentController@handlePaymentResponse')->name('vnpayment.response');
10. Register Module and Services
Ensure your module and its services (like the payment processor) are properly registered within the Laravel application. This might involve updating your ModuleServiceProvider and binding interfaces to implementations.

11. Test and Debug
After completing the implementation, thoroughly test the payment process. Ensure that the payment initiation, transaction with VNPayment, and response handling work as expected. Debug any issues that arise.

12. Security and Validation
Make sure to implement proper security measures, especially for handling payment responses. Validate all incoming data and secure your payment transactions.

13. Logging and Error Handling
Implement logging for payment transactions and error handling to troubleshoot and resolve issues more efficiently.

This implementation provides a comprehensive foundation for a VNPayment module. It's important to tailor the code to fit your specific application context and VNPayment's API specifications. Remember to conduct thorough testing in both sandbox and production environments before going live.

Continuing with the implementation of the handlePaymentResponse function in the VNPaymentController, this method will handle the response from VNPayment after a payment attempt. This involves validating the response, checking the payment status, and then updating your system accordingly.

Here's a detailed implementation:

php
Copy code
<?php

namespace Modules\VNPayment\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Routing\Controller;
use Modules\VNPayment\Entities\VNPayment;

class VNPaymentController extends Controller
{
    public function handlePaymentResponse(Request $request)
    {
        // Get VNPayment configuration
        $vnp_HashSecret = config('vnpayment.vnp_HashSecret');

        // Create the response data array, excluding the vnp_SecureHash
        $responseData = $request->except(['vnp_SecureHash', 'vnp_SecureHashType']);

        // Sort the data by key in ascending order
        ksort($responseData);

        // Build query string & check hash
        $query = '';
        foreach ($responseData as $key => $value) {
            $query .= $key . "=" . $value . "&";
        }

        // Remove last '&' character
        $query = rtrim($query, '&');

        // Generate hash to compare with vnp_SecureHash
        $vnp_SecureHash = hash('sha256', $vnp_HashSecret . $query);
        if ($vnp_SecureHash != $request->vnp_SecureHash) {
            // Hash mismatch, possible tampering detected
            // Log error, notify admin, or take appropriate actions
            return response()->json(['error' => 'Invalid hash'], 400);
        }

        // Process the response
        // vnp_ResponseCode '00' indicates a successful transaction
        if ($request->vnp_ResponseCode == '00') {
            // Handle successful transaction
            // Update order status, trigger any post-payment actions
            // Retrieve the transaction reference
            $transactionRef = $request->vnp_TxnRef;

            // Update the payment status in your database
            // For example:
            // $order = Order::where('transaction_ref', $transactionRef)->first();
            // $order->update(['status' => 'paid']);

            // Redirect or inform the user of the successful payment
            return redirect()->route('payment.success'); // Redirect to a success page
        } else {
            // Transaction failed or cancelled
            // Log the failure, notify user/admin, or take appropriate actions
            return redirect()->route('payment.failed'); // Redirect to a failure page
        }
    }
}
In this implementation:

Validate Response: It first validates the response by rebuilding the hash and comparing it to the vnp_SecureHash received in the response. This ensures that the response is authentic and hasn't been tampered with.

Process the Response: The function then checks if the vnp_ResponseCode is '00', which indicates a successful transaction. Based on this, it processes the order accordingly (e.g., updating the order status in the database).

Handle Different Outcomes: Depending on the response code, the function redirects the user to a success or failure page. In a real-world scenario, you might also send email notifications, log the transaction, or perform other relevant actions.

Security: Ensure that any sensitive data is handled securely, and consider implementing additional security checks as needed.

Logging: Consider adding logging for debugging and auditing purposes.

Remember to adapt this to your application's specific needs and test thoroughly to ensure everything works as expected.
